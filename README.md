## Getting Started üöÄ

Before you dive into the magical world of Ice Nation and its intriguing characters, let's get you set up:

### Prerequisites üìã

1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, head over to [Node.js Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and grab the latest version.

2. **Git**: We use Git for version control. If you haven't already, install it from [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

3. **Visual Studio Code**: Our preferred code editor. Download it from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Setting Up Your Local Environment üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BriefcaseCo/80hdhobbyblog.com.git
   cd 80hdhobbyblog.com
   ```

2. **Using Node Version Manager (nvm)**:
   We're working with Node v18, so let's get you on the right track:
   ```bash
   nvm use 18
   ```

3. **Starting the Development Server**:
   Fire up the server and see the magic happen:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Basic Git Workflow üîÑ

To keep our repository clean and organized, here's a simple workflow:

1. **Pull the Latest Changes**:
   Always start with the latest version:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a New Branch**:
   Let's keep the `main` branch clean. Create a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

3. **Add Your Changes**:
   Made some awesome updates? Great! Add them to your branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**:
   Leave a note on what you did:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "A brief description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push to GitHub**:
   Share your work with the world:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   Head over to [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/BriefcaseCo/80hdhobbyblog.com) and open a pull request from your branch to `main`.

## Continuous Deployment üöÄ

Thanks to Cloudflare Pages, every push to `main` automatically updates [80hdhobbyblog.com](https://www.80hdhobbyblog.com/). Neat, right?

## Story Modification and Creation üìñ‚úçÔ∏è

Ready to weave some narrative magic? Here's how you can modify existing stories or create new ones on 80hdhobbyblog.com.

### Modifying an Existing Story üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Locate the Story Files**:
   Each story lives in its own directory under `/public/stories`. For example, Ice Nation's files are located at `/public/stories/ice_nation`.

2. **Edit Story Content**:
   - To change text, edit the JSON files in the `chapters` folder.
   - To update images, replace files in the `images` folder or update the paths in the JSON files.

3. **Updating Audio Files**:
   Replace or add new audio files in the `audio` folder of the story directory.

### Creating a New Story üå±

1. **Copy an Existing Story Template**:
   Duplicate the folder of an existing story, like Ice Nation, and rename it to your new story's title.

2. **Edit Story Metadata**:
   Update `metadata.json` with your new story's title, author, description, and cover image.

3. **Add Chapters**:
   In the `chapters` folder, add or edit JSON files for each chapter of your new story.

4. **Add Images and Audio**:
   Populate the `images` and `audio` folders with your story's media files.

5. **Integrate with the App**:
   Update the `StorySelectorComponent` in the React app to include your new story in the selection.

## Overview of Key Technologies üåê

### What is Git? üåø

Git is a distributed version control system. It helps you track changes in your code over time. Using Git, multiple developers can work on the same project without stepping on each other's toes. It's essential for collaboration and maintaining the history of your project.

### What is Cloudflare? ‚òÅÔ∏è

Cloudflare provides web infrastructure and website security services. For our project, we're using Cloudflare Pages, a platform for deploying and hosting web applications. It automatically updates our live website whenever we push changes to our GitHub repository.

### React: The Heart of Your Web Application ‚ù§Ô∏è

React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, is the core of our project. It's all about creating interactive and dynamic web pages using components. Think of components as LEGO blocks ‚Äì each representing a part of the UI, which you can reuse and manage independently.

#### Key React Concepts for Beginners:

1. **JSX**: It's a syntax extension for JavaScript, allowing you to write HTML in your JavaScript code. It makes creating UI elements a breeze.

2. **Components**: The building blocks of any React application. Components can be as small as a button or as large as an entire page.

3. **State & Props**: These are how data flows in React. The state is internal data, while props are data passed between components.

4. **Hooks**: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks let you use state and other React features in functional components (components written as JavaScript functions).

### TailwindCSS: Styling Made Simple üé®

TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework. It allows you to style your app directly in your JSX code using predefined classes. This means less time jumping between CSS files and more time designing your UI in one place.

#### Why TailwindCSS Rocks:

1. **Responsive Design**: Tailwind has built-in classes for responsive design. You can easily style for different screen sizes.

2. **Customizable**: Tailwind can be configured to fit your project's design needs.

3. **Utility-First**: You can build complex designs with simple, composable utility classes.

### Additional Tools & Resources üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A powerful, yet beginner-friendly code editor with great React support.

2. **Git & GitHub**: Learning Git is crucial for version control. GitHub is where your code lives, and it's a platform for collaboration.

3. **Node.js & npm**: Node.js runs your development server. npm is the package manager that lets you install libraries (like React and TailwindCSS).

4. **Browser Developer Tools**: Your best friend for debugging. Learn to use the console, network tab, and element inspector.

5. **React Developer Tools**: A browser extension that makes understanding and debugging your React components a walk in the park.
